abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network paradigm in which physical, digital, and virtual objects are equipped with identification, detection, networking, and processing functions to communicate with each other and with other devices and services on the Internet in order to perform the users’ required tasks. Many IoT applications are provided to bring comfort and facilitate the human life. In addition, the application of IoT technologies in the automotive industry has given rise to the concept of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) which facilitated using of Cyber Physic Systems, in which machines and humans interact. Due to the diversity, heterogeneity, and large volume of data generated by these entities, the use of traditional database management systems is not suitable in general. In the design of IoT data management systems, many distinctive principles should be considered. These different principles allowed the proposal of several approaches for IoT data management. Some middleware or architecture-oriented solutions facilitate the integration of generated data. Other available solutions provide efficient storage and indexing structured and unstructured data as well as the support to the NoSQL language. Thus, this paper identifies the most relevant concepts of data management in IoT, surveys the current solutions proposed for IoT data management, discusses the most promising solutions, and identifies relevant open research issues on the topic providing guidelines for further contributions.}

abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the number of sensor and actuator nodes in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks has increased, generating a large amount of data. Most research techniques are based on dividing target data into subsets. On a large scale, this volume increases exponentially, which will affect search algorithms. This problem is caused by the inherent deficiencies of space partitioning. This paper introduces a new and efficient indexing structure to index massive IoT data called BCCF-tree (Binary tree based on containers at the cloud-fog computing level). This structure is based on recursive partitioning of space using the k-means clustering algorithm to effectively separate space into nonoverlapping subspace to improve the quality of search and discovery algorithm results. A good topology should avoid a biased allocation of objects for separable sets and should not influence the structure of the index. BCCF-tree structure benefits to the emerging cloud-fog computing system, which represents the most powerful real-time processing capacity provided by fog computing due to its proximity to sensors and the largest storage capacity provided by cloud computing. The paper also discusses the effectiveness of construction and search algorithms, as well as the quality of the index compared to other recent indexing data structures. The experimental results showed good performance.},
